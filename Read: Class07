### Domain Modeling:

1. We need domain modeling to create conceptual models for a specific problem. 

### HTML Table Basics:

1. It would help if you did not use tables for page layout because the layout tables reduce accessibility for the visually impaired, and tables are automatically responsive. 
2. Three different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table are <td>, <tr>, and <th>. 

### Introducing Constructors:

1. A constructor is used to create more than one object from a single object. One advantage is that we only need to change our code once.
2. “This” is used to call something. Constructor is used to call “this” constructor.

### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor:

1. There's a manager, then two assistant managers, then four employees under them. 
Things I want to learn more about:

The term this differs when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor because "this" is used to call something, and the constructor is used to call a specific constructor.
