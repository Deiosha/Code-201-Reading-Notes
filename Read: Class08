### Learn CSS - Flexbox:
1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. This means a flexbox has more control over alignments and space held inside a container. Because flexbox is one-dimensional, it generally focuses on a layout with a single column, row, or direction at a time.
2. The main axis is the one set by the flex-direction property. Flex items move as a group on the main axis. ​​The main axis follows your flex direction. Cross-axis will allow you to move items as a group or individually. 
3. You should be cautious when using any properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in an HTML document. 
### CSS Layout: Flexbox:
1. Some advantage of using flexbox over float is creating multiple-column layouts on web pages. Flexbox is responsive, and its margins do not collapse.
