1. Data types you can store inside an array are strings, objects, and numbers.
2. â€¦.
3. Assignment x = f(): assigns a value to a variable. Addition assignment x += f(): adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable. Subtraction assignment x -= f(): subtracts the value of the right operand from a variable and assigns the result to the variable. Multiplication assignment x * = f(): multiplies a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable. Division assignment x /= f(): divides a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable.
4. let a = 10; let b = 'dog'; let c = false;. This is because the variables are equal to each output. 
5. A real-world problem is figuring out if you were to look for an outcome of why "x" was happening, you'll use a JavaScript program.
6. Loops would be useful in javascript when performing math equations.
